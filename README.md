This is a [Foru.ms](https://foru.ms/) Next.js starter bootstrapped with the minimal endpoints to get you started.

## Getting Started

First, we need to populate the .env file with the following variables:

```bash
FORU_MS_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
FORU_MS_API_URL="https://foru.ms/api/v1"
```

To obtain an API key, you need to create an account on [Foru.ms](https://foru.ms/) and create a new instance. You can find the API key in the instance settings.

## Running locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to view the app.

## Deploying on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/) from the creators of Next.js.
